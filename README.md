# Translations
Helping to translate Password Safe or add support to a new language is very welcome.  
You can find everything you need at: https://l10n.gnome.org/module/PasswordSafe/

# Supported encryption algorithms
Fully supported are AES 256 encryption algorithm and AES-KDF (KDBX 3.1) derivation algorithm (KeepassXC defaults).
Other algorithms are not supported right now and can may or may not work and/or produce failures.

# Data protection
Please be careful when using development versions. Create enough backups if you're using a production database with Password Safe. It is possible that data loss will occur, though I give my best that this will never happen.  

Development versions create a backup of your database on unlocking by default. These can be found at ```~/.cache/passwordsafe/backup/``` where every backup is named by database name and date. If you don't want this behavior you can turn it off via dconf:  
```
gsettings set org.gnome.PasswordSafe development-backup-mode false
```

# Known issues
* For creating databases is used a workaround because the library can't create new ones (yet).

# Used libraries
There is the awesome pykeepass library from Philipp Schmitt used (https://github.com/pschmitt/pykeepass).
